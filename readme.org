* About

This is a prototype View Engine server as discussed during my talk at
KanDDDinsky conference in Berlin (october, 2017). 

This demo doesn't use event-driven UI model. It sends full UI
layout snapshot on every change.

* Getting started

First, run the demo math exam app (imagine, you are a Russian 1st-grader):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
go run demo/exam/*.go
#+END_SRC

Make sure the app gets through the firewall (OSX might try to block).

Second, install web packages (preferrably via [[https://yarnpkg.com/en/][yarn]]) and launch web UI:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd web
yarn install
yarn start
#+END_SRC

Afterwards direct your browser at  [[http://localhost:3000][localhost:3000]].
